## Welcome! 
This was a project I did with The Odin Project, and I had a interesting time going through it and making this simple rock, paper and scissor game. 

As I was thinking through the logic it needed, I found the technique by Anton Spraul in his book, "Think Like a Programmer" of breaking down each concept out, and writting them out on paper first to be very helpful. Then once I had my code, dev tools in chrome and MDN Web Docs for JavaScript really helped me find and fix up errors in my code.

Overall, this was fun getting to build this project and I'll see what I can learn in the next one.
